<h2> Why I read </h2>
<p>posted on <time datetime="2025-03-05T:06:50">March 05,2025, at 6:50 PM</time>
Reading other books aside form my study material is how I love spending my leisure time. 
There's nothing like making scenes in your head based on the words in a book and feeling like you're in a different world.
I enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. I think a good story can be found in every genre under the sun.
I love the smell of hard copy books and my favorite place to visit in the mall is always Barnes and Noble.
I read most of the contents online ever since I got a Kindle. I have apps like Wattpad, Webtoon, Mihon, kindle, Goodreads and Scribd.
<ul>


   <li> Wattpad:
    </li>

    <li>Webtoon:
</li>

    <li>Mihon:
    </li>

   <li> Amazon Kindle:
</li>

   <li> Goodreads
   </li>

    <li>Scribd:
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3> Why I use these apps</h3>
<ol>
<li> Wattpad has loads of free content and a good number of great undiscovered writers. </li>
<li>When I lack the ability to make my brain wonder and make up scenes for what I'm reading, I make my way to webtoon. Some of the artworks are insane.
 There are a lot of talented people out there. Amazing work of art on Webtoon
I can't imagine the time it takes to make up a charater, have a story, draw them and bring your imagination to life.</li>
<li>I found out about Mihon through my brother.
 I hate having to wait for years before animators put out a new season for an anime.
 So he introduced me to the app and I get to read and finish the stories instead of waiting. 
 I'm just so impatient when it comes to these things.</li>
<li>Amazon kindle was my second online app for reading. 
It is very versatile and it even has a version where the screen is like paper so it doesn't hurt my eyes when I read for hours.</li>
<li>Goodreads is another awesome reading platform. I usually find books from my ethics class on there.</li>
<li>Scribd is a life saver, I have found a couple of study guides and free textbooks on there.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2> Music</h2>
</article>
<p>posted on <time datetime="2025-03-05T:07:00">March 05,2025, at 7:00 PM</time>
Music puts me down, lifts me up, take me to places and let me feel emotions I never knew I could feel.
I listen to music everyday. My mood determines what genre I listen to whenever I turn on my speakers. 
I love all genres from soul to metal. I listen to music when I'm cooking, studying, cleaning, reading, working out or walking around the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Reading and listening to music are more than just hobbies for meâ€”they are ways to escape, explore, and express myself. 
Books transport me to different worlds, expand my perspective, and deepen my understanding of life, while music sets the tone for my emotions, helping me focus, relax, or feel inspired. 
Whether through words on a page or melodies in my ears, both reading and music bring me comfort, creativity, and connection. 
They shape my experiences and make everyday moments more meaningful.
