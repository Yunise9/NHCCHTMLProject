	   Hobbies are activities done by an individual in their leisure time. I believe there are over a thousand types of hobbies and sometimes what one consideres as a hobby might not be considered as a hobby by another. The moment it becomes a chore, it's no longer a hobby.

<div class="container">
        <div class="column">Coloring and drawing; Coloring is calming and drawing is one of the ways I can express my self.</div>
        <div class="column">Photography; I just love going on walks in the parks and taking pictures of whatever I find beautiful.</div>
        <div class="column">Reading and listening to music; I read alot of books during my leisure time. I think it's my favourite hobbie because I do it almost everyday.</div>
        <div class="column">Crochetin; The feeling of being able to make something out of yarn is amazing and so rewarding</div>
	     <div class="column">Scrolling on tiktok; This might actually be my number one hobbie because I spend hour on tiktok. It can get very educative and very toxic real fast, but I'm glad I always find myself on the fun part 80% of the time.</div>

In the end, hobbies are deeply personal and vary from one individual to another. With countless hobbies to choose from, what brings joy to one person might feel like work to another. The true essence of a hobby lies in enjoyment and relaxationâ€”once it becomes an obligation, it loses its meaning. Whether creative, active, or purely for fun, hobbies enrich our lives and provide a much-needed escape from daily routines. So, the key is to find and cherish the activities that bring fulfillment without feeling like a chore.
