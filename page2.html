Coloring is one of the most calming things I have ever done as someone with anxiety. 
I have a couple of intricate or adult coloring books that require patience and delicate hands to achieve the most beautiful pictures ever.
Coloring improves my focus and and concentration. It helps me pay more attention to details and this tranfers to my anatomy and other classes.
Coloring improves my mood and creativity. Whenever I color, I pick out colors, i decide where I want specific colors and how to do my strokes. This is peak creativity and I feel happy after expressing myself on paper.

  I draw because it's a unique way of expressing myself on what I think is perfect. There's this wierd flower that I learned to draw in like 5th grade and I have been drawing it ever since. It can be found in all my notebooks and journals, and every kid that I have babysat has had the experience of learning how to draw the flower.
