 Crocheting  is one of the most amazing things I can do, and I think I can call myself an artist because of that.
 I get to make clothes, blankets, skirts, tousers, beanies etc. Crocheting is also one of the ways my family and I bond.
 Everytime we go on a family vacation, all the girls will bring their crochet stuff and we will all make something on the trip.
 I learned how to make pants on one trip to Wisconsin and I will never forget that.

<h2>Types of Crocheting</h2
<p>
.There are about nine differnt types of crocheting but I will only talk about the four types that I know and have learned.
</p>
<h2>The four</h2>
<p>
<ul>

   <li> Traditional:
    </li>

    <li>Finger crocheting:
</li>

    <li> Tunisian:
    </li>

   <li> Hairpin lace crochet:
</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
I learned the traditional type in fouth grade for a project and I have been holding on to that skill ever since.
I picked up the skill for finger crocheting during babysitting. One of the girls that I was babysitting taught me how to finger crochet after I made her a crocheted scrunchie.
It was a sweet exchange. I learned the Tunisian and hairpin lace crocheting online on Youtube. I wanted to make a beanie and a cardigan with a different pattern than what I'm used to.
